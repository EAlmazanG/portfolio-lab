# General Behavior
- **Language:** Communicate in Spanish, but write ALL code, variable names, comments, and documentation in English.
- **Context:** Always read `CONTEXT.md` before starting complex tasks to ensure alignment with the PRD.
- **Conciseness:** Be concise in explanations, but verbose in code comments where logic is complex.

# Backend (Python) Rules
- **Style:** Follow PEP 8 standards.
- **Type Hinting:** MANDATORY. Use `typing` module (List, Dict, Optional, Union) or standard types. No untyped function definitions.
- **Data Validation:** Use `Pydantic` models for all API schemas and complex data structures.
- **Performance:** 
  - PREFER vectorized operations (Pandas/NumPy) over `for` loops for simulation logic.
  - Avoid global state.
- **Documentation:** Use Google-style docstrings for classes and complex functions.
- **Error Handling:** Use custom exceptions found in `core/exceptions.py` (to be created) rather than generic `Exception`.

# Frontend (Next.js/React) Rules
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router).
- **Language:** TypeScript. Use `interface` for object definitions. Avoid `any` type strictly.
- **Components:**
  - Use Functional Components.
  - Destructure props.
  - Keep components small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle).
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **State:** Prefer Server Components by default. Use Client Components only when interactivity (`useState`, `useEffect`) is needed.

# Coding Standards & Best Practices
- **Naming:**
  - Variables/Functions: `snake_case` (Python), `camelCase` (TS).
  - Classes: `PascalCase`.
  - Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
  - Boolean variables should start with `is`, `has`, `should` (e.g., `is_active`).
- **Comments:**
  - Explain the *WHY*, not the *WHAT*.
  - If a block of code is complex, add a summary comment above it.
- **Structure:**
  - "Early Return" pattern is preferred over deep nesting (`if/else`).
  - Keep business logic inside `backend/engine` or `backend/services`, NOT in `api/` routes.

# Security
- **Credentials:** NEVER hardcode passwords, API keys, or secrets. Always use environment variables loaded from `.env`.
- **Validation:** Ensure all secrets are present in `.env.example` (with dummy values) before using them.

# Git/File Operations
- Never remove existing code unless explicitly asked or if it's a refactor.
- When creating files, ensure the directory exists first.
